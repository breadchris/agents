## 1. Primary Research Data Sources

Primary research involves generating original data through direct interaction with potential customers and market participants. Unlike secondary research, you're creating new insights rather than analyzing existing information.

### Customer Discovery Interviews

One-on-one interviews are the gold standard for early-stage discovery, providing deep qualitative insights into customer problems, behaviors, and motivations.

**Finding Interviewees:**
- **LinkedIn** (free) - Search for job titles matching your target persona, send connection requests with personalized notes
- **Online communities** - Reddit subreddits, Facebook Groups, Slack communities, Discord servers where your target users congregate
- **Industry conferences** - Attend relevant events (costs vary $200-$2,000) for face-to-face conversations
- **Cold outreach** - Email campaigns to companies matching your profile; expect 2-5% response rates
- **Personal network** - Start with warm introductions, ask for referrals to expand reach

**Tools & Logistics:**
- **Calendly** (free-$12/month) - Automated scheduling eliminates back-and-forth
- **Zoom/Google Meet** (free) - Video conferencing for remote interviews
- **Otter.ai** ($0-$20/month) - AI transcription service for automatic note-taking
- **Grain** ($0-$19/user/month) - Records calls and creates highlight reels
- **Notion/Airtable** (free tiers available) - Organize findings, tag themes, track insights

**Sample Size:** For B2B products, 15-25 interviews typically reveal major patterns. For consumer products, aim for 30-50 across different segments. You'll know you've done enough when new interviews stop revealing surprising insights (pattern saturation).

**Best for:** Early problem validation, understanding workflows, uncovering unmet needs, and discovering the language customers use to describe their problems.

### Surveys & Questionnaires

Surveys provide quantitative validation at scale once you've identified hypotheses to test through interviews.

**Platforms:**
- **Google Forms** (free) - Simple, quick surveys with basic analytics
- **Typeform** ($0-$35/month) - Beautiful, conversational survey experience with higher completion rates
- **SurveyMonkey** ($0-$99/month) - Advanced logic, A/B testing, professional templates
- **Tally** (free) - Modern form builder with unlimited responses on free tier

**When to Use:** Deploy surveys *after* interviews to quantify how widespread certain problems or preferences are. Never start with surveys -- you don't know what questions to ask yet.

**Sample Size:** For statistical confidence (95% confidence level, 5% margin of error), you need ~385 responses for large populations. For smaller target markets (<1,000 people), use online sample size calculators.

**Distribution Channels:**
- **Email lists** - If you have an audience; expect 10-20% response rate
- **Social media** - Twitter, LinkedIn posts; offer incentives to boost response
- **Reddit** - Many subreddits allow survey posts if you engage authentically
- **Respondent.io** ($100-$300/hour per participant) - Recruit specific B2B profiles
- **UserTesting** ($49+ per participant) - Consumer and professional panels
- **Prolific** (~$6-$12/hour per participant) - Research-grade participant pool

**Best for:** Validating pricing, measuring willingness to pay, prioritizing features, segmenting your market, and testing positioning messages.

### Focus Groups & Usability Testing

Focus groups (6-10 people) reveal how people discuss problems collectively, while usability testing shows how users interact with prototypes or competitors.

**Platforms:**
- **UserTesting** ($49+ per test) - Videos of users completing tasks while thinking aloud
- **Maze** ($0-$99/month) - Prototype testing with heatmaps and analytics
- **Lookback** ($0-$300/month) - Live moderated user research sessions
- **dscout** (custom pricing) - Mobile ethnography and diary studies

**Format:** Remote testing is faster and cheaper; in-person provides richer context. Sessions typically run 60-90 minutes. Compensate participants $50-$150 depending on seniority and industry.

**Best for:** Testing prototypes, observing real product usage, understanding group dynamics, and identifying usability friction points before building.

### Ethnographic & Observational Research

Shadowing users in their natural environment uncovers unstated needs and workarounds that interviews miss.

**Methods:**
- **Job shadowing** - Spend a day observing someone doing their work
- **Contextual inquiry** - Watch users in their environment while asking questions
- **Day-in-the-life studies** - Document the full context around when/how problems occur

**Tools:**
- **Field notebooks** (analog) - Old-school but effective
- **Evernote/Notion** (free tiers) - Digital field notes with photos
- **Loom** (free-$15/month) - Record screen and narration for remote observation

**Best for:** B2B SaaS understanding workflows, physical product design, service businesses, and discovering non-obvious problem triggers.

### Expert Networks

Paid expert consultations accelerate industry learning and validate assumptions with experienced practitioners.

**Paid Platforms:**
- **GLG (Gerson Lehrman Group)** - ~$300-$1,200/hour depending on expertise
- **AlphaSights** - Similar pricing, strong finance/strategy coverage
- **Guidepoint** - Broad industry coverage, project-based pricing available

**Free Alternatives:**
- **LinkedIn** - Direct outreach offering coffee chats; 10-15% acceptance rate
- **Industry meetups** - Local events where experts attend
- **Podcast guests** - Reach out to recent podcast guests in your space
- **Academic researchers** - Often willing to share insights from their work

**Best for:** Quickly understanding industry dynamics, validating market size assumptions, learning regulatory landscape, and de-risking domain knowledge gaps in unfamiliar markets.

## 2. Public Data & Government Sources

The US federal government maintains the world's largest collection of free, high-quality datasets spanning economics, demographics, industry, and regulatory information.

### US Government Data

**Census Bureau** (census.gov) provides foundational demographic and economic data. The American Community Survey (ACS) offers annual data on population, income, education, housing, and commuting patterns at granular geographic levels -- down to zip codes and census tracts. The Economic Census, conducted every five years, provides detailed revenue and employee data by industry and location. **Example:** A founder building a mobile grooming service can use ACS data to identify zip codes with high pet ownership rates, above-average household incomes, and concentrations of millennials who value convenience services.

**Bureau of Labor Statistics** (bls.gov) tracks employment, wages, productivity, and inflation. The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) dataset shows median salaries by occupation and metro area, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reveals price trends across product categories. **Example:** A SaaS founder targeting dental practices can use OEWS to determine how many dental hygienists and dentists work in their target cities, estimate their wage costs, and understand practice economics.

**Bureau of Economic Analysis** (bea.gov) publishes GDP data, consumer spending patterns by category, and regional economic accounts. The Personal Consumption Expenditures data breaks down where Americans spend money -- healthcare, transportation, food services, recreation. **Example:** Tracking the growth rate of spending on "food services and accommodations" versus "food and beverages for off-premises consumption" helps a restaurant tech founder understand whether dining out is gaining or losing share.

**FRED** (fred.stlouisfed.org) aggregates over 800,000 time series from government sources into a searchable, chartable interface. It includes unemployment rates, housing starts, consumer credit, small business lending, and industry-specific indices. **Example:** A fintech founder can track the "Delinquency Rate on Consumer Loans, All Commercial Banks" to understand credit quality trends before launching a lending product.

**SEC EDGAR** (sec.gov/edgar) contains all public company filings -- 10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks, proxy statements. These documents reveal revenue breakdowns, customer concentration, risk factors, market size estimates, and strategic priorities. **Example:** Reading 10-K risk factor sections from Salesforce, HubSpot, and Adobe reveals common enterprise software buyer concerns.

**Data.gov** serves as the central catalog for federal datasets, indexing over 250,000 datasets from agencies ranging from NASA to the Department of Agriculture. **USAspending.gov** tracks federal contracts and grants, showing which companies win government business and for what services.

### International Government Data

- **World Bank Open Data** (data.worldbank.org) - Development indicators for 200+ countries: GDP per capita, internet penetration, urbanization rates, poverty levels, education metrics
- **OECD Data** (data.oecd.org) - Productivity, taxation, R&D spending, and social policies across wealthy nations
- **UN Data** (data.un.org) - Trade, health, agriculture, and energy statistics from specialized agencies
- **Eurostat** (ec.europa.eu/eurostat) - Harmonized data across EU member states
- **National agencies** - UK's ONS (ons.gov.uk), Statistics Canada (statcan.gc.ca), Australia's ABS (abs.gov.au)

### Patent & IP Data

**Google Patents** (patents.google.com) offers free, searchable access to USPTO, EPO, and WIPO patent databases with advanced filtering by assignee, classification, and citation relationships. **Example:** Searching for recent patents filed by large hospital systems around "remote patient monitoring" reveals which institutions are investing in home health technology, signaling market readiness.

Patent filings indicate where companies are investing R&D dollars 12-18 months before products launch. Tracking competitor patent activity reveals strategic direction. Citation analysis shows which technologies are building on prior innovations.

### Regulatory & Legal Databases

- **Federal Register** (federalregister.gov) - Proposed and final rules; anticipate regulatory changes
- **Congress.gov** - Bill tracking showing legislative momentum around issues like data privacy or healthcare reform
- **CFPB Complaint Database** (consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints) - Millions of complaints about financial products revealing consumer pain points
- **FTC Complaint Database** - Consumer protection complaint patterns
- **FDA databases** (fda.gov) - Recall data, adverse event reports, and product approval timelines

### Academic & Research

- **Google Scholar** (scholar.google.com) - Peer-reviewed papers, theses, and working papers
- **PubMed** (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) - Biomedical literature
- **SSRN** (ssrn.com) - Social science preprints

## 6. Technical & Product Intelligence

### App Store & Product Launch Data

**Product Hunt** (producthunt.com) -- Free. Track daily tech launches, upvote counts, and comment threads. Use the "Topics" filter to monitor specific verticals. Products hitting 500+ upvotes in 24 hours indicate strong early adopter resonance. When multiple apps launch addressing the same pain point within 60 days, you're witnessing simultaneous problem discovery.

**Sensor Tower** (~$99+/month) and **data.ai** (freemium) -- Download estimates, revenue projections, competitive benchmarking. **Use case:** Search "expense tracking" in the finance category. If top apps have 2.5-3 star ratings with complaints about "confusing receipts," you've found a UX improvement opportunity.

### Developer & API Ecosystem

**GitHub** (github.com/trending) -- Free. A repo gaining 1,000+ stars in a week signals developer pain. Use "Used by" count to gauge production adoption versus hobbyist interest. **Use case:** Supabase's rapid star growth signaled demand for Firebase alternatives.

**npm trends** (npmtrends.com) and **PyPI Stats** (pypistats.org) -- Free. Package download trajectories. Rising downloads for authentication libraries suggest developers want drop-in solutions. If a category shows 10+ competing packages with modest traction, the market is fragmented and ripe for consolidation.

**StackShare** (stackshare.io) -- Free. Self-reported tech stacks from 1M+ companies. If Series A SaaS companies overwhelmingly adopt Linear over Jira, that's a generational shift signal.

**HG Insights** and **Datanyze** ($10K+/year) -- Install-base data for market sizing. Knowing that 15,000 companies use Salesforce + Slack but lack unified analytics helps size your addressable market.

### No-Code & Tool Usage Signals

**Airtable Universe** and **Notion Templates** -- Free. Expose workflows people build when proper software doesn't exist. A popular "Bug Tracking" Airtable base with 10K+ copies suggests alternatives are needed for non-technical teams.

**Zapier** (zapier.com/apps) -- Free to browse. Integration popularity by "Zap count." If "Google Sheets to Slack" has 500K+ active Zaps, people are hacking notification systems -- opportunity for a dedicated product. **Make/Integromat** reveals complex multi-step automation templates.

**Use case:** Browse Notion's "CRM" templates. If 20+ templates exist for "Freelance Client Management" with thousands of duplicates, freelancers lack affordable CRM.

### AI & Emerging Tech Monitoring

**Papers With Code** (paperswithcode.com) -- Free. Sort by "most implemented papers." When a technique gets 50+ implementations rapidly, it's moving toward production viability.

**Hugging Face** (huggingface.co) -- Free. Model download stats indicate practical AI adoption. Models with 1M+ downloads in specific domains signal validated enterprise use cases.

**Stanford HAI AI Index Report** (aiindex.stanford.edu) -- Free annual macro trends. **Gartner Hype Cycle** (~$5K for reports) positions technologies on the innovation curve. **ThoughtWorks Technology Radar** (thoughtworks.com/radar) -- Free quarterly enterprise CTO priorities.

**Use case:** If Papers With Code shows 10+ papers on "SQL generation from natural language" with improving benchmarks, and Hugging Face has 500K+ downloads of text-to-SQL models, but Gartner places it in "Peak of Inflated Expectations" -- you're 12-18 months from mainstream adoption, perfect timing to build tooling.
